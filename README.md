# Windows Hello for Business Implementation
This repository holds all of my scripts and resources for implementing Windows Hello for Business into a new or existing environment. 

The files that are prefixed with "Create-" create new resources in Azure, these can be ignored if using on-premises machines such as VMWare ESXi or Workstation VMs. The files that are prefixed with "Deploy-" are specific to each machine (Domain Controller, Certificate Authority, Web Server) and are intended to be run from within each machines environment.
